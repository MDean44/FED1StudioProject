            <h1>Fish Types</h1>
            <p>
               <p> <b>Bass</b> </p>
                Largemouth, smallmouth, and spotted bass are the most popular game fish in North America. When fishing, lures (Bass worms) or live bait will work. Lures that mimic baitfish, worms, crayfish, frogs, and mice are all effective. The largest bass on record was 22lbs, 4oz. And in the state of Kansas and Missouri where we will be fishing the records are; 11 lbs, 12.8 oz and 13 lbs, 14 oz!</p>
            <p>
               <p> <b>Catfish</b> </p>
                Blue cat, channel cat, and flatheads are the most popular game fish in North America. When fishing, chicken liver, hot dogs, blue gill, and stink bait are all great types of bait that you can use. The largest catfish on record was 646 lbs!! The Kansas and Missouri state records are; 102 lbs, 8 oz and 117lbs! </p>
            <p>
               <p> <b>Crappie</b> </p>
                White and black crappie are the most popular game fish in North America. When fishing, lures (rooster tail), minnows, and fake minnows are all kinds of ways you can catch these fish. The largest crappie on record was 5 lbs, 4 oz. And for the state of Kansas and Missouri the records are; 4 lbs, 6 oz and 4lbs, 8 oz.</p>
